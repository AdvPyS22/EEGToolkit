# AP-EEG

## Project description
> ## EEG data analysis
> Students who choose this task ill be provided with the raw EEG recording of one channel, sampled at $500 [Hz]$ which was recorded from a participant presented with auditory stimuli. The students will also receive an events file describing when during the recording one out of two possible sounds were presented to the subject.
> ### Task 1
> Extract the time-period from $0.1 [sec]$ before to $1 [sec]$ after each event for the EEG signal. Store these time-periods in two arrays, one for each of the two event-/sound-types.
> ### Task 2
> Plot the average response for each type of event, with shading for the standard error. On the plot, also indicate $t=0$, the amplitude of the signal in microvolts (Y-axis), and the time relative to sound onset in $[ms]$ (X-axis).
> ### Task 3
> For each sound type, for each time-point after sound onset, test wheter it is significantly different across trials from the baseline. Also test at what time-points after sound onset the EEG signals for the two sound-types are different from each other. Produce one plot containing the average EEG signal of each sound type, along with lines indicating the significant time-periods.
