    "### Further ideas\n",
    "The first improvement that should be done, would be to implement a module for signal preprocessing. Such module could be developed partially with the `scipy` library and the various processing methods it offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "To go further with our project, we could extend the EEGData class to support multiple EEG signals, thus working on the signals in different position of the scalp.\n",
    "\n",
    "With such extension we could also develop topological and tomographical tools using libraries dedicated to the subject such as [`visbrain`](http://visbrain.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we could create statistical tools to compare the responses between subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of the scope of the base project, the support for other brain imaging technologies such as fNIRS or fMRI could be implemented. Implementing theese methods would require the use of a GLM instead of the averaging done with EEG and a more sophisticated preprocessing should also be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great examples of what is now implemented for neuroimaging is presented on [nipy.org](https://nipy.org/) !"
